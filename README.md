## Description
Spenzoo is a expense tracking app that cultivates budgeting and expense tracking habits by incorporating zoo game feature. When the user logs budget and expenses they will be rewarded with points that they can use to buy items to customize their zoo. The user can also assign each animal to an expense category they want the animal to keep track off. The user must manage the happiness level of the animals by frequently opening the app. They can also increase the animal by shaking the app. 

## Audience
Someone who has just started to manage their own finances and is trying to formulate a habit of budgeting and tracking expenses. We expect the zoo building game aspect of the app to be more appealing to the younger audience who are familiar with such type of game. We assume our target audience to be in the ages between 16 and 35.
